                <li>1/4 Cup All-Purpose Flour</li>
                <li>2 Cups Chicken Broth</li>
                <li>1 Cup Whole Milk</li>
                <li>1 tsp Dried Thyme</li>
                <li>Salt and Pepper to Taste</li>
                <li>Fresh Parsley, Chopped for Garnish</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>For the Topping</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp Baking Powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Baking Soda</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp Salt</li>
            <li>12 Cup Unsalted Butter, Cold and Cubed</li>
            <li>1 Cup Buttermilk</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup Grated Cheddar Cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>In a large skillet or ovenproof pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, carrots, celery, and garlic. Sauté until the vegetables become tender, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the flour over the sautéed vegetables and stir to form a roux. Cook for a minute or two to remove the raw taste of the flour.</li>
            <li>Gradually pour in the chicken broth and whole milk, stirring constantly to create a smooth sauce. Bring the mixture to a simmer, and let it cook until it thickens, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the cooked chicken, frozen peas, frozen corn, dried thyme, salt, and black pepper. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>For the biscuit topping, in a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the cold, cubed butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work it into the dry ingredients until you have a coarse, crumbly mixture.</li>
            <li>Pour in the buttermilk and gently stir until just combined. Do not overmix.</li>
            <li>Drop spoonfuls of the biscuit dough onto the chicken mixture in the skillet, spreading them out evenly. If desired, sprinkle grated cheddar cheese on top of the biscuit dough.</li>                <li>Place the skillet in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the biscuits are golden brown and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Once done, remove the chicken cobbler from the oven and let it cool slightly. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley.</li>
        </ol>
